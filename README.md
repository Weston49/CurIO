# CurI/O
an open source neat python project I did



If you play to run this as of when I first published it won't be easy,
as of now you need to install of the dependencies on your own computer for this to work.
I am working on creating an EXE and an APP
that was you can run both CurI/O and PlayableCurI/O without the need to install python3 and neat and whatnot
